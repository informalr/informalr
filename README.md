## Coding via Discord

We develop our packages, while chatting on Discord.
To join, send Richel a Discord Friend Request: `richelbilderbeek#9002`.
He'll add you to the `informalr` server.

## FAQ

### What is the goal of `informalr`?

To learn how to develop professionally in a team in an informal setting using R.

### What is meant by 'professionally'?

That we follow the literature, which means we will:

 * Use a package as a development unit (not an R script, not a vignette)
 * Use `git` for version control, where each person has his/her own branch
 * Use GitHub for collaboration
 * Employ test-driven development
 * Use Travis CI for continuous integration
 * Use `lintr` to check for style
 * Use `covr` to check for code coverage
 * Use `goodpractice` for miscellaneous good practices

See, for example, [here](https://github.com/richelbilderbeek/PresentationsAboutR)
for multiple videos we will follow.

### What is meant by 'in a team'?

That we work together. 
A beginner will be taught by a more experienced team member.
We will be doing pair programming.

### What is meant by 'informal'?

This means that:

 * You are allowed to grab a beer
 * If you cannot be there, this is always fine 
 * We only work during our meetings

### How will we do that?

By working on projects as a team. In practice, we will be writing packages.

### What projects will we be working on?

First, we'll write some trivial packages to get used to the workflow.
After this, the team decides on a project by majority vote.

### What should my minimal level be?

There is none.
